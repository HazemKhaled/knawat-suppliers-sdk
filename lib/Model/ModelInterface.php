 * Knawat Supply API allows you to list your products on Knawat and get purchase orders, it's also allow you to set order status and shipping tracking number. ## Getting Started In Knawat each supplier has a different `consumerKey` and `consumerSecret`, which you can get from your account manager. You need those keys for API authorization. Knawat suppliers npm package: [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40knawat%2Fsuppliers.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40knawat%2Fsuppliers). ## Support and Chat   We are happy to receive your questions. click here to [chat with us](https://gitter.im/Knawat/Lobby).  ## Errors Handling   This API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the status of a   response.    There are two main categories of error responses. Each have a different   response payload structure.    * Simple errors   * Detailed errors    # Simple errors    | Name | Code | Description |   | -------- | -------- | -------- |   | Bad request     | 400     | The request was unacceptable     |   | Unauthorized     | 401     | The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.     |   | Forbidden     | 403     | The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it     |   | Not Found     | 404     | The server has not found anything matching the request URI     |   | Not acceptable     | 406     | The server is unable to return a response in the format that was requested by the client     |   | Unsupported Media Type     | 415     | The server is refusing to service the request because the entity of the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method |   | Too many requests     | 429     | Too many requests hit the API too quickly |   | Server error     | 500     | A technical error occurred |    # Detailed errors   | Name | Code | Description |   | -------- | -------- | -------- |   | Un-processable entity     | 422     | The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but was unable to process the contained instructions. |
